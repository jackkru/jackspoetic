# Jack's Poetic Blog

I wanted to experiment with web development and wanted to force myself to write more. This project combines those two. 

## What This Is

This is my personal website - a simple blog built with Flask where I can:
- Write and share blog posts
- Upload and display images
- Share my poetry and creative work
- Document interesting experiences and thoughts

## How It's Built

I bought the domain name via route 53 in AWS.
I created an ec2 instance. 
I wrote a flask app to run on that ec2 instance. 
I connected the ec2 instance to the domain name.

## Features

- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes with a button in the navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Blog Posts**: Markdown support with syntax highlighting
- **Image Support**: Upload and display images in posts
- **Theme Persistence**: Your theme preference is saved in your browser

## About Me

I'm Jack, and this is where I write about things that interest me - from chess and AI to poetry and personal experiences. It's a space for my thoughts and creative work.
