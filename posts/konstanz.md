I have been to the place where the river meets the lake<br>
I have walked those paths that line the shores<br>
Where an old bike creaks through the damp forest<br>
And the cicadas form a deafening chorus<br>
<br>
I have been to the place where the river meets the lake<br>
I have swum in the cold and dived in the night<br>
Where new friends share a familiar dish<br>
And the water is too clean for even a fish<br>
<br>
I have been to the place where the river meets the lake<br>
I have spoken the language and jumped from the bridge<br>
Where a clear day brings views of snow-capped peaks<br>
And Gl√ºhwein warms your frozen cheeks<br>
<br>
I have been to the place where the river meets the lake<br>
I have built islands to float above the mighty depths<br>
Lived through the lonely months when the world shut down<br>
With Bismarck, watching over the quiet town<br>
<br>
I have been to the place where the river meets the lake<br>
You would like the place where the river meets the lake<br>
Enjoyed board games, bonfires, sports and learning<br>
In a place that made the homesickness a little less burning
