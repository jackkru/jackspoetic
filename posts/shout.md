excerpt: The one poem I ever wrote that I wasn't ashamed of

# Shout

I wrote this in pen in a notebook during a big lecture sometime early in my UNC years. 
I told people it was the one poem I had ever written that I wasn't ashamed of. I thought I had lost it, but I found it in an old google doc that was a collective suite blog for the people living in Morrison. It's not as strong as I remember, and I'm tempted to alter it before publishing. But we're here to wax poetic, not perfect and polish. So here it is, unedited, almost a full decade later. 

    I wanna shout
		but that’s not acceptable
	Whip my mouth letting slobber and
		noise
	          free
	But society
		society disapproves


	I think if I was
		friends
	With each individual in this room
		they would get me
	They wouldn’t mind
		if I shout
	But as a group
		they’d disapprove


	Not sure that I’m so different
		If stranger screams
	Hopefully I’d support
		But I don’t know him
		Why is he screaming
		This is not a place for that
		This is not a time for that
