# Welcome

Hello and welcome! The purpose here is twofold - web development and creative writing. I wanted to practice both, so here I am and here you are. 

## What to Expect

As the domain name implies, I'm planning on doing some talking. I'm just another fella with too much to say. The pieces I post here will not be heavily researched, and you are unlikely to walk away with great insight. I'm doing this for me, waxing poetic about whatever I fancy. Expect reflections, recaps and short observations, written in different styles depending on my mood.
